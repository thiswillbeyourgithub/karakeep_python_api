# Karakeep Community Scripts

This part of the repository is where Community Scripts are stored.

Don't hesitate to create PR to add your own:
- Think of a good name, ideally something that is easy to find when using search engines. And the name of the directory should ideally match the name of the script.
- Include a README.md
- Include a VERSION variable, for example `VERSION: str = "1.0.0"`
- Mention your script to the table in the README.md at the root of the repository.
- If you think your script should be known of the entire community, think about adding it to the table in [the official Karakeep documentation](https://docs.karakeep.app/community-projects)
- If possible run [black](https://pypi.org/project/black/) on your code before doing the PR.
